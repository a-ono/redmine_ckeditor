== CKEditor customization

To activate the plugin you have to copy the plugin directory into assets/ckeditor-contrib/plugins and restart Redmine, then configure toolbar settings.

=== Skins

You can select third-party skins placed in assets/ckeditor-contrib/skins directory.

=== Configuration

You can configure {CKEditor settings}[http://docs.ckeditor.com/#!/api/CKEDITOR.config] and HTML sanitizer by using the REDMINE_ROOT/config/ckeditor.yml file.
    cp plugins/redmine_ckeditor/config/ckeditor.yml.example config/ckeditor.yml

== Migration notes

This plugin stores contents in HTML format and renders as is.
If you have old contents, these look weird.

You can use {redmine_per_project_formatting}[https://github.com/a-ono/redmine_per_project_formatting] plugin for backward compatibility or execute redmine_ckeditor:migrate task for migrating old text to HTML.
    rake redmine_ckeditor:migrate RAILS_ENV=production FROM=textile TO=html
You can also use PROJECT parameter to migrate only specific projets
    rake redmine_ckeditor:migrate RAILS_ENV=production PROJECT=project_identifier1,project_identifier2 FROM=textile TO=html 
This task requires to {install Pandoc}[http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html].

    cd app/assets/javascripts/ckeditor-releases
